\title{Find missing LaTeX packages from a LaTeX log file}
\usage{
parse_packages(log, text = readLines(log), files = detect_files(text), 
    quiet = rep(FALSE, 3))
}
\arguments{
\item{log}{Path to the LaTeX log file (typically named \file{*.log}).}

\item{text}{A character vector of the error log (read from the file provided
by the \code{log} argument by default).}

\item{files}{A character vector of names of the missing files (automatically
detected from the \code{log} by default).}

\item{quiet}{Whether to suppress messages when finding packages. It should be
a logical vector of length 3: the first element indicates whether to
suppress the message when no missing LaTeX packages could be detected from
the log, the second element indicate whether to suppress the message when
searching for packages via \code{tlmgr_search()}, and the third element
indicates whether to warn if no packages could be found via
\code{tlmgr_search()}.}
}
\value{
A character vector of LaTeX package names.
}
\description{
Analyze the error messages in a LaTeX log file to figure out the names of
missing LaTeX packages that caused the errors. These packages can be
installed via \code{\link{tlmgr_install}()}. Searching for missing packages
is based on \code{\link{tlmgr_search}()}.
